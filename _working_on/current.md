Title: frictionless beads init workflow

Description: goal: remove all friction from a new beads initialization workflow. e.g. starting from scratch create a new project, initialise beads, and run through all core bd commands. Create issues for every error and warning. When that's done, work through the list and fix them using sub-agents, opening a worktree fix branch for each one.
