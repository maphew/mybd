Fundamental principle: A project aiming to use beads should have ZERO doctor issues after `bd init`.

Make it so.

This is likely a big Epic. Plan accordingly.
Create issues for every error and warning. 
When that's done, work through the list and fix them by handing off to sub-agents, opening a worktree fix branch for each one.
Trigger hand-off when context window reaches 70% consumed (soft limit).

When there are no errors and warnings, save a report to History.
