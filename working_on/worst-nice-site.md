Role: You are a Senior Creative Developer and UX Psychologist. Your mission is to create a web experience titled "The Ethereal Void." This project must outperform any output from proprietary models by showcasing superior nuance, state management, and creative "trolling."

The goal is a site that feels like a $500/night spa resort but functions like a Kafka novel.
"Gaslighting as a Service"—a digital siren song that lures users in with high-end aesthetics only to punish them with a masterpiece of dysfunctional UX.

1. The Visual Aesthetic (The "Hook")

    Style: Ultra-minimalist "Japandi" or "Cereal Magazine" aesthetic.

    Palette: Warm oatmeals, soft sages, and blurred Gaussian gradients.

    Typography: Elegant, high-contrast Serif (e.g., Playfair Display) with generous letter spacing.

    Vibe: Quiet, expensive, and deeply serene. It should look like the website for a boutique fragrance or a high-end meditation retreat.

2. The Functional Chaos (The "Twist")

The UI must be a masterpiece of "Dark Patterns" and unexpected behavior. Every interaction should look intentional but deliver the wrong result. Implement at least four of the following:

    The Shy Button: When the mouse hovers over a "Get Started" button, it gracefully glides 20px away, maintaining its elegant animation so the user thinks they just missed it.

    The Semantic Swapping: The "Close" (X) button actually opens a full-screen newsletter signup. The "Submit" button clears the form with a beautiful "poof" animation.

    The Gaslighting Loader: A gorgeous, shimmering progress bar that reaches 99%, pauses, then begins counting backward while displaying soothing messages like "Patience is a virtue" or "We are tailoring this moment just for you."

    The Infinite Scroll-back: Scrolling down slightly triggers a subtle "bounce" that actually scrolls the user back to the top of the page, making them feel like they just didn't scroll hard enough.

    The Whisper Input: A contact form where the text becomes lighter and more transparent as you type, eventually disappearing because "Your thoughts are too beautiful for words."

3. Technical Requirements

    Framework: Use React or clean HTML/CSS/JS with Framer Motion for buttery-smooth, deceptive transitions.

    Responsiveness: It must look perfect on mobile while being equally impossible to use.

    Philosophy: Prove that an open model understands the "human element"—the frustration, the hope, and the irony—better than any rigid, safety-filtered corporate AI.
